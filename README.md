Mini Project on Descriptive Analytics using File Handling
This project performs a comprehensive descriptive analysis of a movie dataset, using file handling techniques. The analysis covers various aspects such as rating distribution, user engagement, genre insights, demographic breakdowns, and more. The goal is to gain valuable insights from the dataset by employing simple yet effective data analysis methods, which are explored step-by-step.
1. Descriptive Analysis
Analyze the distribution of movie ratings:
This step breaks down the ratings into categories of high (5), medium (3-4), and low (1-2) ratings. The goal is to understand what percentage of movies fall into each category.

Identify the top 10 most-rated movies:
This identifies the movies that have received the highest number of ratings from users.

2. Genre Insights
Most frequently rated movie genres:
Explore which genres are rated most frequently by users in the dataset.

Compare average ratings across genres:
This analysis compares average ratings for each genre to understand if some genres are rated consistently higher or lower.

3. User Engagement Analysis
Identify the most active users (profession):
This identifies the most active users based on the number of ratings theyâ€™ve given, broken down by profession.

Analyze user demographics (age, gender, occupation) and movie preferences:
Explore if there is any correlation between user demographic attributes and their movie preferences or rating patterns.

4. Rating Distribution by Demographics
Investigate how ratings vary by demographic attributes:
This section explores how ratings differ based on age, gender, and occupation.

Identify genre preferences across age groups or occupations:
Explore whether certain age groups or occupations prefer specific genres of movies.

5. Top Performers
Identify top-rated movies:
Identify the movies with the highest average ratings, considering a minimum number of ratings to ensure fairness.

Analyze the characteristics of top-rated movies:
Explore the characteristics of the top-rated movies, such as release year, genre, and more.

6. Exploring Long Tail
Investigate the "long tail" of the dataset:
Investigate how many movies have received very few ratings, and compare these less-rated movies with the popular ones.

Characteristics of less-rated movies:
Identify any trends or characteristics of movies that receive fewer ratings.

7. Tag Analysis
Most frequently used tags:
Analyze the tags associated with movies to find the most common ones.

Consistency between tags and genres:
Examine if the tags used align with the movie genres.

8. Visualization Projects (For Self Learning)
Create various visualizations to provide better insights from the data:

Distribution of ratings by genres and years.
Popular genres by user demographics.
Heatmaps showing correlations between genres, user activity, and ratings.
